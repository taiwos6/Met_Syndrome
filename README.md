# Overview
This is a Metabolic Syndrome Prediction Flask app trained with Random forest, KNN, Logistic regression models and stacking ensemble technique with deployment done in Heroku. 

Metabolic syndrome is the medical term for a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension) and obesity. It puts you at greater risk of getting coronary heart disease, stroke and other conditions that affect the blood vessels.
On their own, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity can damage your blood vessels, but having all 3 together is particularly dangerous. They're very common conditions that are linked, which explains why metabolic syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 3 older adults aged 50 or over in the UK.

The aim of this project is to identify patients at risk of developing Metabolic Syndrome and also to assist front-line staff in identification and detection of Metabolic Syndrome.

## Dataset

## Algorithms
The algorithms leveraged in this project are Random Forest, KNN, Logistic Regression and Stacking ensemble and the AUC-ROC Curve is the metric used for model evaluation.

The **Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)** curve is an evaluation metric for binary classification problems. The **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** is the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve. **The higher the AUC, the better the performance of the model at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes**.
