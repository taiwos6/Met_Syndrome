# Overview
This is a Metabolic Syndrome Prediction Flask app trained with Random forest, KNN, Logistic regression models and stacking ensemble technique with deployment done in Heroku. 

Metabolic syndrome is the medical term for a combination of diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension) and obesity. It puts you at greater risk of getting coronary heart disease, stroke and other conditions that affect the blood vessels.
On their own, diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity can damage your blood vessels, but having all 3 together is particularly dangerous. They're very common conditions that are linked, which explains why metabolic syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 3 older adults aged 50 or over in the UK.

The aim of this project is to identify patients at risk of developing Metabolic Syndrome and also to assist front-line staff in identification and detection of Metabolic Syndrome.
